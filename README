Hi,

In out assignment we used the Stanford ner tagger, It requires download a heavy weight JAR file.
If you only intention is to run the code on the DEV given file you can use a workaround so you dont need the NER tagger.
Simply use the pickle file that we saved and submitted. you just need to change the LOAD_FROM_PICKLE parameter in the utils file.
If you want to run it on a different test file you must install the stanford tagger.

our code run as follows.
python Predict.py clean_input_file_name input_processed_file_name gold_annotation

We used a trained SVM model, therefore we use two addtional files.
saved_model_short and feature_map_file.txt that should be located in the same directory as the Predict file.

which is saved in the save_model_short file. Please verify that it is in the same directory as the Predict file.

If you intended to run the code on the DEV file you can use a pickle file that saved the stanford tagging.  Please install it id you want to run the full code.
